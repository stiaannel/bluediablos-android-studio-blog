## Welcome to this archive

This is the first post and addition to this website.

This blog serves as a archive for all tools I used and how to get it working.

## Tools you might need

- Any debian based Linux (using the apt package manger) I personally use: [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/).
- Alternatively [Google Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/) would work instead of installing linux.
- Common problem solving skills, if something doesn't work, troubleshoot it, read the docs, and try again.
